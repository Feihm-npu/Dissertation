\section{Summary of the project and project Plan}
Currently, the project is still in the development stage. As stated in Chapter 4, reinforcement learning and GAT still suffer from implementation problems. For the short term goal, in the next few weeks till 12/22's meeting,
the main task is to implement modeling attack or achieve prediction accuracy higher than 80\%. During these weeks, the XGBoost was a new idea to try if both the previous machine learning fail to implement or model the arbiter PUF. 
However, more research on XGBoost was required. In addition, the paper \cite{Reference11} need to be read and fully understand, then prepare a presentation for 12/22's meeting.


In the long term, after the modeling attack is implemented, start on designing a reconfigurability framework to prevent the attack. The framework that was mentioned in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 will be considered. The framework
is expected to be implemented at the end of March 2022 so there will have enough time for testing and writing dissertation.
