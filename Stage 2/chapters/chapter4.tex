\section{Project progress}
The project has two part, currently the progress are at the point of discovering and implement machine learning for modeling the arbiter PUF. Methods such as reinforcement learning
and graph attention neural network(so called GAT). The reinforcement learning types that was implemented is the SARSALambda Q learning. The basic idea is//// The accuracy for modeling is around
69\%, which is not a satisfying result. As for the GAT, there are some problem that need to solve. The basic idea of the GAT is that the ////. In the future, XGBoost will be 
consider as well.
