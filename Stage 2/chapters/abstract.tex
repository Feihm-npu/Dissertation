This report investigates and provides a clear introduction on PUF(physical unclonable function),
the aim of the project and current progress. In introduction, there are thoroughly description on
PUF, reconfigurability framework and concepts corresponding to specific machine learnings
for modeling attack on PUF.

The aim of the project is to propose a novel, suitable machine learning to model PUF(physical
unclonable function) and then design a reconfigurability framework to fight against such
attack. The PUF structure is similar to a road network so machine learning related to
ETA(estimated time arrival) problem is strongly considered.

The achievements to date are having a robust understanding of PUF, reconfigurability property,
and an attempt to implement reinforcement-learning and Graph attention neural network as modeling attack. SARSALambda Q
learning has been tested on PUF but only around 60\% accuracy has been achieved. Graph attention neural network
is implemented as well, but will need to adapt to dynamic input.
