This report investigate and provide clear introduction on PUF(physical unclonable function), aim of the project and current progress.
In introudction, there are thoroughly description on PUF, reconfigurability framework and concepts corresponding to specific machine learnings for modeling attack on PUF.
\par

The aim for the project is to propose a novel, suitable machine learning to attack PUF(physical unclonable function)
and then design a reconfigurability framework to fight against such attack. The PUF structure is similar to a road network so 
machine learning attack related to ETA(estimated time arrival) problem is strongly considered.
\par

The achievements to date are having robust understanding on PUF, reconfigurability property, and attempt to implement reinforcement learning as modeling attack. 
SARSALambda Q learning reinforcement learning has been tested on PUF but according to false implementation, only 50\% accuracy has been achieved.
The Actor-Critic reinforcement learning are considered to be useful at the moment, while further research are progressing to validate the usability.
